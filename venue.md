The 10th International Workshop on Empirical Software Engineering in Practice (IWESEP 2019) will be held at Nishiwaseda Campus of Waseda University. The workshop room will be located on the ground floor of Building No. 55, N Tower.

Nishiwaseda campus is located at a very convenient place in Tokyo. There are three train stations near that campus.

* [Tokyo Metro] Fukutoshin line, Nishi-Waseda (西早稲田 / F11) Station (3 min on foot)
* [JR] Yamanote line, Takadanobaba (高田馬場 / JY15) Station (13 min on foot)
* [JR] Yamanote line, Shin-Okubo (新大久保 / JY16) Station (15 min on foot)
Using Nishi-Waseda station is the most convenient option to get to the workshop venue. If you are getting off at Nishi-Waseda station, please leave from Exit 3 (not Exit 1 or 2). This exit will take you directly to the campus. Building No. 55, where the workshop will be held, stands very closely to that exit. Be aware that it will take a few minutes walk if you use other exits.
