### <font color="MediumSeaGreen">Requirements for the first phase</font>
<b>All software engineering researchers and students can join the first phase!!</b>  

### <font color="MediumSeaGreen">Requirements for the second phase</font>
The main aim of the second phase is to encourage young researchers/students to develop a new research network and to provide them with opportunities for research collaborations. Hence, only the participants satisfying the following requirements:<br>
<b>1. Young Researchers:</b> Doctoral program students, Master program students who plan to attend a Doctoral program, or researchers who are less than 10 years after Ph.D. acquisition.<br>
<b>2. Working on MSR studies</b>


### <font color="MediumSeaGreen">Registration fee</font>
- <b>The first phase:</b> 0 JPY
- <b>The second phase:</b> You can choose either of these options: 
  - With accomodation: 27,000 JPY (including a shared room for two nights, breakfast, dinner, coffee, and snacks. Accomodation fee is 11,000 JPY per night.)
  - Without accomodation: 5,000 JPY (including only coffee and snacks)

NOTE: For the second phase, if you prefer to staying a private room, please choose the option "Without accomodation" and arrange accommodation on your own as well as breakfast and dinner. And please make sure to <b>arrange the same accommodation</b>. We plan to hold a night session. So, if you book another hotel, it might be difficult to attend such sessions. Please contact us directly if you have any reasons or want to stay at another hotel. 


### <font color="MediumSeaGreen">What you have to prepare?</font>
<b>For the first stage at Sapporo central, (i.e., invited talks),</b> you need to arrange accommodation by yourself (even the participants of the second phase). 

<b>For the second phase at Jozankei (i.e., Researchathon),</b> 
We are going to provide the second phase participants with the accommodation for 24th and 25th's nights (if you are willing to stay in a shared room). If you prefer to staying in a private room (i.e., if you don't ask us to arrange the hotel), please book Jozankei view hotel or any hotels around by yourself. 

Note that the first day (23th July) will be held in Sapporo, and the rest of the days will be held in Jozankei. So, please carefully check the address of the hotels. You also need to prepare the flight ticket yourselves.
