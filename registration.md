We are going to provide the second phase participants with the accommodation for 24th and 25th's night (If you are willing to stay in a shared room). If you prefer to staying in a private room (i.e., if you don't ask us to arrange the hotel), please book Jozankei view hotel or any hotels around by yourself. 

Note that the first day (23th July) will be held in Sapporo, and the rest of the days will be held in Jozankei. So, please carefully check the address of the hotels. You also need to prepare the flight ticket yourselves.
