Important: Every participant can attend the first phase. However, the main aim of the second phase is for young researchers/students to make a new network and encourage them to start a new collaborative research project. Hence, we will ask for some requirements. 

## Requirements for the second phase
- Doctoral program student or Master program student who plans to go to Doctoral program or researchers who have obtained a Ph.D. within 10 years
- Main research area is MSR


## Registration fee
- The first phase: 0 JPY
- The second phase: around 30,000 JPY, including a room for two nights, onsen, breakfast, and dinner. 

The first phase is free. But the second phase needs around 30,000 JPY for the participation fee, including a room for two nights, onsen, breakfast, and dinner (if you want the organizers to arrange the hotels). If you prefer to have a private room, please arrange accommodation on your own.

## What you have to prepare?
If you want the organizers to arrange the hotel, you don't need to prepare the accommodation for 24 and 25. Of course, you have to prepare the accommodation for other days. If you prefer a private room (if you don't ask us to arrange the hotel), you have to book the accommodation yourselves for all days. Note that the first day (23) will be held in Sapporo, and the rest of the days will be held in Jozankei. So, please carefully check the address of the hotels. You also need to prepare the flight ticket yourselves.
